Responsive sharing buttons for sharing current URL to Facebook, Twitter and Google+

== Description ==
Sharedom provides the user with responsive sharing buttons for Facebook, Twitter and Google+ (more in later upgrades) that share the current URL. It is really simple and light-weight and comes with a shortcode that can be dropped anywhere to instantly show the sharing buttons.

== Installation ==
